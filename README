Doormand, Version 0.81

It should be noted that this is 'beta' software, and, of this date, has been
tested only under SuSE Linux 7.1 through 9.3.  While doormand should compile
and run on most linux distributions, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and OSX (Darwin)
it has not yet been tested on them.  'knock' has been tested on these platforms,
and functions correctly.


KNOWN PROBLEMS:

1....  "Silent Doorman"
        The doorman will occasionally (via 'pcap') "guess" the 
        data-link header length of the interface it listens on incorrectly.
        If this happens, the doorman will do NOTHING when it receives a
        'knock'.
        It will not recognize it as a knock, and so will not even log its
        receipt.   If you experience this problem of a stubbbornly silent
        doorman, use a command line such as this:

        ./doormand -D -X -f ./doormand.cf.TEST

        This will dump all received UDP packets on the port the doorman
        is listening to.  Send a few 'knock' packets, and look for "45 00"
        in the  dump.   These are  usually  the  first 2 bytes of the IP
        header; count the number of bytes before them, and you have length
        of the data-link header.   Use this number as the value for
        the "link-header-length" configuration option in 'doormand.cf'.
        If you have counted correctly, the doorman should function 
        properly when restarted.
        (Thanks to Robert Koropcak for letting me log onto his personal
        machine to let me figure how to fix the "silent doorman" problem)


2....   "64-bit segfaults"
        Under 64-bit systems such as SuSE9.3 for the Athlon 64, connection-
        watching child processes of the doorman will seg-fault just before
        the point at which they would normally exit after closing the firewall
        hole which was created for a now-disconnected session.  This, while
        merely annoying by itself, probably indicates serious problems with heap
        corruption.  To be fixed...

HOW TO BUILD for *NIX :

---  If you are updating from a previous version, and have modified
---  your firewall scripts, BACK UP YOUR OLD CONFIGURATION FILES!
---  (doormand.cf & guestlist will not be over-written.)
---  > su -c"cp -r /usr/local/etc/doormand /usr/local/etc/doormand.OLD"

The impatient may simply issue the commands:

> tar -xvzf doormand.tgz
> cd doormand
> ./configure
> make
> su -c"make install"

(For a full explanation of 'configure', read 'INSTALL',
or issue the command: ./configure --help)

After this, as root, 'cd' to the doorman's configuration directory
(by default, '/usr/local/etc/doormand'), and create suitable
'doormand.cf' & 'guestlist' files.  Examples are provided.
Also see 'man doormand.cf' & 'man guestlist'.

So far, no system startup & shutdown scripts are provided, due
to wide variation from one OS to another.  You will have to
roll yer own for the time being.  Sorry.  However, a script
which functions under SuSE Linux v7.1 is pasted at the end of
this file as an example for fellow Linux weenies. ;)

The doorman requires the utility program 'lsof'.
While the doorman may SEEM to run well without 'lsof', it will 
never be able to remove the holes it punches in the firewall for 
connections.   Eventually, you will have a firewall like piece of
Swiss cheese, all tattered with old 'accept' rules.  This is BAD.

You can get lsof at:
< ftp://lsof.itap.purdue.edu/pub/tools/unix/lsof/lsof.tar.gz >


By default, 'knock' is installed in /usr/local/bin,
'doormand' in /usr/local/sbin, and the doormand configuration
files and sample firewall scripts in /usr/local/etc/doormand .
See 'INSTALL' to select different installation directories.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO BUILD for WINDOWS :

Only the 'knock' client may be built for windows.
Knock.c can be compiled with Microsoft Visual C++; double-click
on 'WINNOCK.DSW', and build as normal.
