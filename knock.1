.TH knock  1 "April 17 2006" "Port-knocker, V0.9" "Doorman & Knocker"

.SH  NAME
.B knock
\- The port-knock client 
.SH  SYNOPSIS
.nf
knock [-h] [-v] [-f cfgpath] [-g groupid] [-p port] [-s secret] \\
      [-r program arg1 arg2 ... ]   host  service

.SH DESCRIPTION
"Knock on the door" of a host running the 'doorman' daemon.  
If the conditions outlined below are met, a firewall rule will be created 
for a short time allowing a TCP connection on the requested port.  If a
connection is made within this time, the rule will be left in place until
the connection is broken.
.br
No reply is made to the knock; success is apparent only when a connection to
the requested server has been made.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fR
 'help'; print a message explaining the options and quit.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
 'version'; print the version number and quit.
.TP
\fB\-p port\fR
Override the 'port' value in .knockcf.  Knock on the specified UDP port.
.TP
\fB\-f cfgpath\fR
Use the configuration file specified by 'cfgpath' rather than ~/.knockcf
.TP
\fB\-g groupid\fR
Override the 'group' value in .knockcf
.TP
\fB\-r "program arg1 arg2..."\fR
Override the 'run' value in .knockcf.  Run this program after sending the
knock packet.  The argument list given to the program may include the special
strings %H% and %P%.  '%H%' substitutes for the hostname to which the knock
is sent; '%P%' substitutes for the portnumber or service name.
.br

Example:   knock -r"ssh -l myname %H%" abc.whatever.org ssh
.br

To avoid running the program specified by the 'run' record, use any of:
.br
-r " " , -r ' ' , -r0 , -rX , or -rx
.TP
\fB\-s secret\fR
Override the 'secret' value in .knockcf
.br
.TP
\fB\ host\fR
the IP address or DNS name of the host to which a TCP connection is
desired.
.TP
\fB\ service\fR
the port number or service name (as defined in /etc/services)
of the desired service.

.SH CONDITIONS
In order for a knock to succeed, the following conditions must be met:
.br

1. the groupid must be in the doorman's 'guestlist' file
.br

2. the secret must match that in the guestlist record for that group
.br

3. the IP address of the client machine's interface must match one of
the addresses in the guestlist record.
.br

4. the service requested must be in the guestlist record
.br

5. A randomly-chosen number (called a 'tag') is sent in the knock packet; it
must not occur in a list of old tags kept by the doorman.  It may
occasionally happen that a tag is found in the list, and the knock
will fail; there is no other remedy for this but to make
another attempt.  However, since tags are 32 bits in magnitude, such
occurrences should be rare.
.br

.SH FILES
.BR ~/.knockcf :
the configuration file for 'knock'.
.br
 '.knockcf' must be readable and writeable only by the owner.
