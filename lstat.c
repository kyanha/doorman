	File: 'lstat.c'

 This file exists only to fake out the autoconf/automake
 tools, which occasionally (on a few OS's) create a configure
 file which in turn creates a Makefile which will DEMAND that 
 'lstat.o' exist.

 This file will disappear as soon as I figure out what
 the #%*! is going on.   Thenkew.
