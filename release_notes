Notes:
The Doorman is "port-knocking" listener daemon which helps you 
secure private servers.   It allows a Unix or GNU/Linux server to run 
invisibly, with all TCP ports closed.

This is still 'beta' software.  Of this date, has been tested only
under SuSE Linux 7.1, 8.1, & 9.0.
While the doorman daemon should build and function on most linux 
distributions,  as well as FreeBSD, netBSD, OpenBSD, and
MacOS X, only 'knock' has been tested on them.
