.TH doormand.cf  5 "April 18 2006" "Doorman, V0.9" "Doorman & Knocker"

.SH NAME
.B doormand.cf
\- The
.I doormand
configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is the main configuration file for the 
.I doormand
daemon.  It consists of simple keyword-value pairs, one pair per line;
keywords are not case-sensitive.
Any part of a line following a '#' character is
ignored, and may be used as a comment.  Blank lines are permitted.
Unrecognized keywords are ignored without warning messages.
.br


.SH KEYWORDS
.HP 4
.B connection-delay-1
\- the maximum number of microseconds to wait for a complete
3-way handshake between the client and the requested service,
after seeing the initial 'SYN' from the client.
.br
Default value is 500000 usecs (one half second)
.HP 4
.B connection-delay-2
\- the number of seconds delay between checks on an established connection,
waiting for it to be broken.  When the doorman 
finds the connection has been broken, it removes the firewall rule which
permitted that connection.   Default is 5 seconds.
.HP 4
.B firewall-add
\- the full pathname of the script to be used to add firewall rules.
No default.
.HP 4
.B firewall-del
\- the full pathname of the script to be used to delete firewall rules.
No default.
.HP 4
.B guestlist
\- the full pathname of the doorman's "guest list".  No default.
.HP 4
.B link-header-length
\- the number of bytes in the data-link header of the interface that
the doorman is listening on.  You only need to specify this if 'pcap' guesses this 
value incorrectly; this is rare, but -has- been reported, usually on PPPoE interfaces.
The doorman uses the 'pcap' package
("Packet Capture"; the Berkeley packet filter package) to watch for packets.
If pcap gets the data-link header length wrong, the doorman will not recognize
knock packets, and will do and log absolutely nothing.

To determine the correct value to use, dump received packets to standard output
by using the doormand "-D" and "-X" command-line options.
Send a few 'knock' packets, and look for "45 00" in the dump.
These are usually the first 2 bytes of the IP header; count the number of bytes
before them, and you have length of the data-link header.
.HP 4
.B interface
\- the device name of the interface at which which the doorman should
listen.  No default.
.HP 4
.B logfile
\- the full pathname of the file to which events are logged; this may
be the system messages logfile if desired.
Default is "/var/log/doorman".
.HP 4
.B loglevel
\- the name of the severity level at which logging should occur.
The names are not case-sensitive.
Valid level names, in order of severity, are:
.nf
    DEBUG  INFO  NOTICE  WARNING
    ERROR  CRIT  ALERT   EMERG
.fi
For normal usage, INFO or NOTICE will probably be the preferred level.
Default level is DEBUG.
.HP 4
.B pidfile
\- the full pathname of the process-ID file created by doormand.
Default is "/var/run/doorman.pid".  Doormand removes this file just 
before it stops running, except in the case of a program crash,
after which it must be removed manually.
.HP 4
.B port
\- the UDP port number at which the doorman should listen for "knocks".
Default is 1001.
.HP 4
.B hash-archive
\- the name of the file in which information about old "knock" packets is stored.
The doorman uses this file to make sure that a successful knock cannot be re-used by
someone sniffing traffic to your firewall.
.HP 4
.B hash-archive-size
\- the number of old knocks which are to be remembered.
This must be at least 1000, but should be 50000 or more, to make replay
attacks difficult.  The hash archive consumes 20 bytes of disk space per knock.
In the current implementation, some knocks may be lost
when the doorman is restarted after this value is reduced, causing
the archive to be re-created as a smaller file.
Default is 100000 knocks.
.HP 4
.B waitfor
\- the number of seconds that may elapse after a valid "knock", during
which a connection may be made to the requested service.
Default is 10 seconds.
