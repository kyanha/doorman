knock(1)                Doorman &amp; Knocker                knock(1)



<b>NAME</b>
       <b>knock </b>- The port-knock client

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       knock [-h] [-v] [-U] [-t s.s] [-p port] \
             [-f cfgpath] [-g groupid] [-s secret]  host  service


<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       "Knock  on  the door"  of a host running the 'doorman' dae
       mon.  If the conditions outlined below are met, a firewall
       rule  will be created for a  short time allowing a TCP con
       nection on the requested port.  If a  connection  is  made
       within this time, the rule will be left in place until the
       connection is broken.
       No reply is made to the knock; success  is  apparent  only
       when a connection to the requested server has been made.


<b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-h </b>    'help'; print a message explaining the options and
              quit.

       <b>-v </b>    'version'; print the version number and quit.

       <b>-p </b><b>port</b>
              Override the 'port' value in 'KNOCK.CFG'.  Knock on
              the specified UDP port.

       <b>-f </b><b>cfgpath</b>
              Use this as the configuration file, rather than
              '%USERPROFILE%\KNOCK.CFG'.  See 'FILES', below.

       <b>-g </b><b>groupid</b>
              Override the 'group' value in 'KNOCK.CFG'.

       <b>-r </b><b>"program </b><b>arg1 </b><b>arg2..."</b>
              Override  the  'run'  value in KNOCK.CFG.  Run this
              program after sending the knock packet.  The  argu­
              ment list given to the program may include the spe­
              cial strings %H% and %P%.   '%H%'  substitutes  for
              the hostname to which the knock is sent; '%P%' sub­
              stitutes for the portnumber or service name.

              Example:   knock -r"ssh -l  myname  %H%"  abc.what­
              ever.org ssh

              To avoid running the program specified by the 'run'
              record, use any of:
              -r " " , -r ' ' , -r0 , -rX , or -rx

       <b>-s </b><b>secret</b>
              Override the 'secret' value in 'KNOCK.CFG'.

        <b>host </b> the  IP  address or DNS name of the host to which a
              TCP connection is desired.

        <b>service</b>
              the port number or  service  name  (as  defined  in
              /etc/services) of the desired service.


<b>CONDITIONS</b>
       In  order for a knock to succeed, the following conditions
       must be met:

       1. the groupid must be in the doorman's 'guestlist' file

       2. the secret must match that in the guestlist record  for
       that group

       3. the IP address of the  client machine's interface  must
       match  one  of  the  addresses  in  the  guestlist  record

       4. the service requested must be in the guestlist record

       5. A  randomly-chosen  number (called a 'tag') is sent in
       the knock packet; it must not occur in a list of old  tags
       kept  by  the  doorman.  It may occasionally happen that a
       tag is found in the list, and the knock will  fail;  there
       is  no  other remedy for this but to make another attempt.
       However, since tags are 32 bits in magnitude, such  occur-
       rences should be rare.


<b>FILES</b>
       <b>KNOCK.CFG</b>, the configuration file for 'KNOCK.EXE'.
       The default location is %USERPROFILE%\KNOCK.CFG .

       Windows XP and Windows 2000/2003, etc:
       "C:\Documents and Settings\&ltusername&gt\KNOCK.CFG"

       Windows NT:
       "C:\WINNT\Profiles\&ltusername&gt\KNOCK.CFG"

       Windows 95/98/ME:
       "C:\KNOCK.CFG"
