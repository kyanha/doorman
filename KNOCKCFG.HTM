KNOCK.CFG               Doorman &amp; Knocker             KNOCK.CFG



<b>NAME</b>
       <b>KNOCK.CFG </b>- The <b>knock </b>configuration file

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The port-knocker client KNOCK.EXE requires a configuration
       file with a default name of "KNOCK.CFG" to be in a certain
       directory.  See "LOCATION", below.
       Any  value  in  the file may be overridden by command-line
       parameters to <b>KNOCK.EXE</b>.

       The file consists of simple keyword-value pairs, one  pair
       per  line.  The keyword and value must be separated by one
       or more space or tab characters.   Keywords are not  case-
       sensitive,  though  most  values  are.  Any part of a line
       following a '#' character is ignored, and may be used as a
       comment.  Blank lines are ignored.

<b>LOCATION</b>
       The location  and name  of the configuration file  may  be
       specfied  with  the  "-f"  command-line  parameter to  the
       knocker; see KNOCK.TXT.  Otherwise, the location  at which
       KNOCK.EXE expects to find  it depends upon the  version of
       Windows that  you are using.   The paths below assume that 
       windows  was installed  at the default locations.    To be
       precise, the knocker will expect KNOCK.CFG to the at:
       <b>%USERPROFILE%</b>\KNOCK.CFG   If you are  still unsure where
       to put your config file, call up a DOS window and say:
       <b>SET USERPROFILE</b>
       This will spit out the directory where you should place
       KNOCK.CFG.

       Win 95, 98, & ME: (these don't have USERPROFILE defined)
          C:\KNOCK.CFG

       WinNT:
          C:\WINNT\Profiles\&lt;username&gt;\KNOCK.CFG

       WinXP, 2K, etc:
          C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;username&gt;\KNOCK.CFG


<b>RECORDS</b>
        <b>group </b> &lt;name&gt;
              This specifies the group name (guest name) used  to
              identify  yourself.   Group  names  may be up to 32
              characters in length.  Both group names and secrets
              may   contain   any alphanumeric character, as well
              as the characters:  !@$%^&amp;*()_-+=|{};:'"&lt;&gt;,?/

              Note that whitespace, "#", and the "." character
              (period, or decimal point) are not permitted.

        <b>port </b> &lt;integer, 1-65534&gt;
              Knock on the specified UDP port.

        <b>secret </b> &lt;password&gt;
              This  is  the  password used to authenticate you to
              the doorman.  Secrets  may be up to  64  characters
              in  length, and use the same character set as group
              names.  The secret is catenated with the IP address
              of the client machine and seconds-of-epoch, and put
              through an MD5 hash before being sent to the  door­
              man.

              This  record may be omitted from KNOCK.CFG; if it is
              missing, and the  secret  is  not  included  as  an
              option  on the command line (generally not a bright
              idea, anyway), 'knock' will prompt you for one.

        <b>run </b> "program  arg1 arg2 ... "
              Run  this  program  after sending the knock packet,
              and after a 1/10th second  pause.   Note  that  the
              entire command must be enclosed in either single or
              double  quotes.    Two  special  strings   may   be
              included to substitute for command-line parameters.
              %H% substitutes for the hostname or IP address, and
              %P%  substitutes  for  the requested port number or
              service name.


 <b>AN </b><b>EXAMPLE</b>

       #
       #  If any of these records is missing, its value may be
       #  specified with a command-line option.
       #  (You may omit the secret from both, and wait to be prompted.)
       #
       group    marketeers           # "Who you are" to the doorman
       secret   b1g%Hairy_[seCret}!  # &lt;- This is why you might want
       #                                  to leave this record out...
       #                                  A PLAINTEXT PASSWORD!
       #                               You can wait to be prompted for
       #                               it, or use '-s &lt;secret&gt;'
       #
       port     1001                 # The UDP port the doorman is watching
       run      "PuTTY myname@%H%"   # Run 'PuTTY' after knocking.
       #                               The hostname used in the knock command
       #                               will be subsituted in place of '%H%'.
