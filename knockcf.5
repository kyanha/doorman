.SH  NAME
.B .knockcf
\- The
.I knock
configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
The port-knocker client
.I knock
requires a configuration file named ".knockcf" to be in the user's home
directory.  Any value in the file may be overridden by command-line
parameters to
.I knock
.br

The file consists of simple keyword-value pairs, one pair
per line.  The keyword and value must be separated by one or more space
or tab characters.   Keywords are not case-sensitive, though most values
are.
Any part of a line following a '#' character is
ignored, and may be used as a comment.  Blank lines are ignored.
.br

The file MUST be readable and writeable ONLY by the owner.
.br

.SH RECORDS
.TP
\fB\ group\fR  <name>
This specifies the group name (guest name) used to identify yourself.
Group names may be up to 32 characters in length.  Both group names
and secrets  may  contain  any alphanumeric character, as well as
the characters:  !@$%^&*()_-+=|{};:'"<>,?/
.br

Note that whitespace, "#", and the "." character (period, or decimal point)
are not permitted.
.TP
\fB\ secret\fR  <password>
This is the password used to authenticate you to the doorman.
Secrets  may be up to 64 characters in length, and use the same
character set as group names.
The secret is catenated with the IP address of the
client machine and the seconds-of-epoch, and put through an MD5 hash
before being sent to the doorman.
.br

This record may be omitted from .knockcf; if it is missing, and
the secret is not included as an option on the command line
(generally not a bright idea, anyway), 'knock' will prompt you
for one.
.TP
\fB\ port\fR  <integer, 1-65534>
Knock on the specified UDP port.  The default is port 1001.
.TP
\fB\ run\fR  "program  arg1 arg2 ... "
Run this program after sending the knock packet, and after a 1/10th second
pause.  Note that the entire command must be enclosed in either single or double
quotes.   Two special strings may be included to substitute for command-line
parameters.  %H% substitutes for the hostname or IP address, and %P%
substitutes for the requested port number or service name.

.br

.SH
\fB\ AN EXAMPLE\fR
.br
.nf
#
#  If any of these records is missing, its value may be
#  specified with a command-line option.
#  (You may omit the secret from both, and wait to be prompted;
#   this is perhaps the safest [or most paranoid] way on a unix host)
#
group       marketeers           # "Who you are" to the doorman
secret      b1g%Hairy_[seCret}!  # <- This is why no one else should
#                                     be able to read this file...
#                                     A PLAINTEXT PASSWORD!
#
port        1001                 # The UDP port the doorman is watching
#
run         "ssh -lmyname %H%"   # Run 'ssh' after knocking.
#                                  The hostname used in the knock command
#                                  will be subsituted in place of '%H%'.
