.TH guestlist  5 "April 18 2006" "Doorman, V0.9" "Doorman & Knocker"

.SH  NAME
.B guestlist
\- The secondary
.I doormand
configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
The doorman daemon
.I doormand
requires a list of permitted "guests", or groups.
There must be one record per group, with the following order:
.br

<groupname> <secret> <port1> <port2> .. <address1> <address2> .. 

Records may span multiple lines.  The groupname MUST begin on
the first character of a line.  Continuation lines MUST 
be preceeded by at least one character of whitespace (tabs or spaces).
Tabs and space characters may be freely used in any order.
.br

Any part of a line following a '#' character is
ignored, and may be used as a comment.  Blank lines are ignored.
.br

This file MUST be readable and writeable by root, only.
.br

.br
.HP 4
.B groupname
\- The name which is sent by a
.I knock
client to identify itself.  Group names may be up to 32 characters in
length.  Both group names and secrets may contain any alphanumeric character,
as well as the characters:  !@$%^&*()_-+=|\\[]{};:'"<>,?/

Note that whitespace, "#", and the "." character (period, or decimal point)
are not permitted.
.br
.HP 4
.B secret 
\ - an authenticating password.  This is sent by the client as an MD5 hash
salted with the client's IP address and the rounded seconds-of-epoch.
.br

Secrets may be up to 64 characters in length, and use the same character 
set as group names. (Remember: -no- periods!)
.br

The existence of this secret in plaintext on both the client and server
machines is the reason this file, and the client's
.I ~/.knockcf
file, must be readable only by their users.   Under NO circumstances should
it correspond to anything in any 'passwd' file anywhere.
.br
.HP 4
.B port1 port2 ..
\- a whitespace-delimited list of the ports to which the group may connect.
A port may be specified as a number or a service name;  that is, "22" and "ssh"
are equivalent.  Service names are case sensitive.
.br
.HP 4
.B address1 address2 ..
\- a whitespace-delimited list of IP addresses or hostnames from which the
group may connect.  Addresses may be unique, or expressed as ranges by means
of an "/nbits" modifier.  Using a hostname to specify a range is permitted.
There must be no whitespace before or after the "/" character.
.br

.PP
.B An example record:
.br
.nf
group187  b1g%Hairy_[seCret}!                    # groupname & secret
          ssh 23                                 # allowed ports
          1.2.3.4/16   5.6.7.8  x.myplace.org/24 # allowed addresses
