doormand(8)                    Doorman &amp; Knocker                   doormand(8)



<b>NAME</b>
       <b>doormand </b>- The doorman daemon

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       doormand [-h] [-v] [-D] [-f config-file]


<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  doorman  daemon  "guards  the door" of a host running TCP servers,
       admitting only recognized parties.  (The current implementation of  the
       doorman  can  only  protect TCP services.)  It allows a server which is
       not intended for general public access to run with most (or  even  all)
       of it's TCP ports closed to the outside world.

       A  server  may thus be made invisible to a cracker's portscans; attacks
       can be mounted on such a host only if it's existence is known by  other
       means.   Moreover, any vulnerability in a specific program is made much
       more difficult to exploit, as the the  firewall  simply  drops  packets
       from parties the doorman does not recognize.

       The  doorman watches all packets arriving at a specified interface on a
       specified UDP port.  When a valid packet from <b>knock </b> is  detected  (see
       'conditions'  below),  doormand runs the first of two shell scripts, as
       configured in <b>doormand.cf. </b> It is the responsiblity of these scripts to
       manipulate the firewall rules to allow a TCP connection from the origi-
       nating IP address.

       There is one script to add rules, and one to delete rules.   The  first
       call to the 'add' script sets a broad firewall rule; open to one desti-
       nation port, but from any source port at the  originating  IP  address.
       The second call to that script sets a narrow rule; open to only one one
       source port at the originating IP address.

       Between the knock and a connection on the requested port,  the  doorman
       will wait for a configurable number of seconds.  If none is made within
       that time, the 'delete' script is run to re-close the firewall.   If  a
       connection  is  made,  the source port of that connection is noted; the
       'add' script is run to narrow the firewall hole, and then the  'delete'
       script is run to delete the first, broader, rule.

       The sequence of calls to the scripts, if all goes well, is this:

           a valid 'knock packet' received...
        *--&gt; add broad rule
           wait...  a TCP connection allowed by the broad rule is made...
        *--&gt; add narrow rule (we now know the source port)
        *--&gt; delete broad role (don't need it anymore)
           the client &amp; server converse; eventually, the client goes away...
        *--&gt; delete narrow rule

       No  reply  is  made  to a knock; success is apparent to the client only
       when it discovers that a connection to the  requested  service  can  be
       made.


<b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-h </b>    'help'; print a message explaining the options and quit.

       <b>-v </b>    'version'; print the version number and quit.

       <b>-D </b>    Run  in  "Debug"  mode.  Doormand will not daemonize, and remain
              attached to the console; file ownership  and  permission  checks
              are skipped, and logging is done to stdout.

       <b>-f </b><b>config-file</b>
              Use  the  specified configuration file.   The default configura-
              tion    file    is    named    "doormand.cf"    in     directory
              "/usr/local/etc/doormand",  or  the  directory  specified by the
              configure  "--sysconfdir"  option  when  building  <b>doormand </b> and
              <b>knock.</b>



<b>CONDITIONS</b>
       A  knock  packet  contains 4 space-delimited ASCII strings: portnumber,
       groupname, a "random" decimal number called a "tag", and  an  MD5  hash
       formatted  as  a hexadecimal number of 32 characters.  The knock client
       creates this hash from the the group's shared secret, salted  with  the
       first  3  fields.   The  doorman  performs  the same MD5 operation, and
       checks that the two hashes are  identical.   If  they  are,  the  knock
       client must know the secret, and is let in.

       Therefore,  in  order  for a knock to succeed, the following conditions
       must be met:

       1. the groupid must be in the doorman's 'guestlist' file

       2. the secret must match that in the guestlist record for that group

       3. the IP address of the client machine's interface must match  one  of
       the addresses in the guestlist record.

       4. the service requested must be in the guestlist record

       5.  the tag must not be "stale"; that is, it must not have already been
       used on a successful knock.  (The  doorman  keeps  a  hashed  table  of
       information about successful knocks.)


<b>SCRIPTS</b>
       Ready-made  scripts  are  supplied  for  Linux,  FreeBSD,  netBSD,  and
       OpenBSD:

        ipchains_add &amp; ipchains_delete ... Linux 2.2 'ipchains'
        iptables_add &amp; iptables_delete ... Linux 2.4+ 'iptables'
        ipf_add &amp; ipf_delete           ... netBSD 'ipf'
        ipfw_add &amp; ipfw_delete         ... FreeBSD 'ipfw'
        pfctl_add &amp; pfctl_delete       ... OpenBSD 'pf'

       The 'firewall-add' and 'firewall-del' records  in  <b>doormand.cf </b> specify
       which set of these scripts will be executed.

       For  other  firewall types, scripts must be supplied by the administra-
       tor.  Both 'add' and 'delete' scripts are invoked with  this  parameter
       list :

               $1         $2      $3         $4       $5
       interface-name   src-ip  src-port   dest-ip  dest-port

       When  adding  or  deleting "broad" rules, the value of $3, the src-port
       parameter, will be set to a single '0' character.  Add &amp; delete scripts
       may  check  for  a  zero  value to determine the firewall command to be
       issued.

       Both scripts must return a status by writing a string to stdout. A nor-
       mal return is indicated by single ascii '0' (0x30) character.

       Errors  encountered  while  running  the  script should be indicated by
       returning  a non-zero integer (perhaps  'errno',  but  '-1'  will  do),
       followed by a numeric severity level:

         EMERG   0    ALERT  1    CRIT 2    ERROR 3
         WARNING 4    NOTICE 5    INFO 6    DEBUG 7

       Severity values of 0..3 will cause the forked doormand process for that
       connection to log the event and exit.  Levels 4..7 will cause the event
       to be logged, but processing will continue.

       The  message  written to the logfile will also contain whatever text is
       written after the severity level; this may be extra information on  the
       nature of the error, if so desired by the script writer.

       An example error return:
          -1 3 Permission denied


<b>SIGNALS</b>
       <b>SIGHUP </b> may  be used force  the parent doormand process to re-read it's
       configuration and guest-list files.  Any  children  preparing  new,  or
       monitoring  established connections will continue to use old configura-
       tion data.

       <b>SIGTERM, </b><b>SIGSTOP, </b><b>SIGQUIT, </b>and <b>SIGINT </b>may be used to shut the  doornman
       down  in  an orderly fashion.  Any children processing connections will
       exit, after removing any firewall rules for which they are responsible.
       There  may  be a delay of up to "connection_delay_2" (man <b>doormand.cf </b>)
       before children exit.


<b>FILES</b>
       <b>doormand.cf:</b> the configuration file for doormand. (man 5 doormand.cf)

       <b>guestlist:</b> the list of guest (or group) names containing a  secret  for
       authentication,  and  information about which services they may connect
       to, and from what IP addresses. (man 5 guestlist)

       <b>doormand.pid: </b>the process-ID file created by the parent  doormand  pro-
       cess.   The full pathname is specified by the 'pidfile' record of <b>door-</b>
       <b>mand.cf. </b> Doormand will refuse to run if this file already  exists;  it
       must be removed manually after a program crash.

       <b>A </b> <b>hash </b> <b>archive: </b> a file containing information on previous successful
       knocks.  In the current implementation, this file should not be  shared
       with  other doorman processes. If the 'hash-archive-size' configuration
       parameter is changed to a smaller value, some stored knocks may be lost
       due  to hash collisions upon insertion into the new table.  The archive
       stores the 128-bit MD5 hash contained in the knock, and  the  time,  as
       GMT,  that  the successful knock was received.  The size of the archive
       should be made as large as possible without consuming  an  inconvenient
       amount  of memory and disk space.  This is to reduce the number of hash
       collisions; in the event of a collision where the two MD5 hashes  match
       exactly, the doorman assumes a "replay" attack, logs a warning message,
       and refuses entry.  However, in the event of a collision where the  MD5
       hashes do not match, the new knock simply over-writes the old.

       <b>A </b><b>firewall-add </b><b>script.</b>

       <b>A </b><b>firewall-delete </b><b>script.</b>


<b>CAVEAT</b>
       Three  vulnerabilites of this approach spring immediately to mind.  The
       first is that the guest  "secrets"  must  exist  as  plaintext  in  the
       guestlist  file,  and may also exist (plaintext again!) in the client's
       <b>.knockcf </b>or <b>knock.cfg </b>file.  These secrets must therefore NEVER  corre-
       spond to ANY passwords ANYWHERE ELSE.

       Note  also  that  coredumps from doormand crashes will also contain all
       guest-list secrets in plaintext.

       Second, it is still possible for  a  cracker,  connected  to  the  same
       client  machine  as  a legitimate user (L.U.), and able to sniff L.U.'s
       traffic, to 'slip in' before L.U.
       (This problem is mitigated somewhat by the fact that the attacker would
       still  have  to  authenticate.   Hoewever,  he might briefly be able to
       launch attacks against vulnerabilities in the server at that port.)

       Third, the doorman runs with root permissions.  It is therefore  possi-
       ble  that  the doorman itself may be attacked, in hopes of exploiting a
       buffer overflow or similar bug.

       The doorman does present a formidable barrier to a cracker, but not  an
       impenetrable one.
