<b>NAME</b>
       <b>guestlist </b>- The secondary <b>doormand </b>configuration file

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  doorman  daemon <b>doormand </b>requires a list of permitted "guests", or
       groups.  There must be one record per group, with the following order:

       &lt;groupname&gt; &lt;secret&gt; &lt;port1&gt; &lt;port2&gt; .. &lt;address1&gt; &lt;address2&gt; ..

       Records may span multiple lines.  The groupname MUST begin on the first
       character  of a line.  Continuation lines MUST be preceeded by at least
       one character of whitespace (tabs or spaces).  Tabs and  space  charac-
       ters may be freely used in any order.

       Any  part  of  a  line following a '#' character is ignored, and may be
       used as a comment.  Blank lines are ignored.

       This file MUST be readable and writeable by root, only.


       <b>groupname </b>- The name which is  sent  by  a  <b>knock </b> client  to  identify
           itself.   Group  names  may be up to 32 characters in length.  Both
           group names and secrets may contain any alphanumeric character,  as
           well as the characters:  !@$%^&amp;*()_-+=|\[]{};:'"&lt;&gt;,?/

           Note  that whitespace, "#", and the "." character (period, or deci-
           mal point) are not permitted.

       <b>secret </b> - an authenticating password.  This is sent by the client as an
           MD5  hash  salted with the client's IP address and the rounded sec-
           onds-of-epoch.

           Secrets may be up to 64 characters in  length,  and  use  the  same
           character set as group names. (Remember: -no- periods!)

           The  existence  of  this secret in plaintext on both the client and
           server  machines  is  the  reason  this  file,  and  the   client's
           <b>~/.knockcf </b> file,  must be readable only by their users.   Under NO
           circumstances should it correspond to anything in any 'passwd' file
           anywhere.

       <b>port1 </b><b>port2 </b><b>.. </b> - a whitespace-delimited list of the ports to which the
           group may connect.  A port may be specified as a number or  a  ser-
           vice  name;  that is, "22" and "ssh" are equivalent.  Service names
           are case sensitive.

       <b>address1 </b><b>address2 </b><b>.. </b> - a whitespace-delimited list of IP addresses  or
           hostnames  from  which  the  group  may  connect.  Addresses may be
           unique, or expressed as ranges by means of  an  "/nbits"  modifier.
           Using a hostname to specify a range is permitted.  There must be no
           whitespace before or after the "/" character.


       <b>An </b><b>example </b><b>record:</b>
       group187  b1g%Hairy_[seCret}!                    # groupname &amp; secret
                 ssh 23                                 # allowed ports
                 1.2.3.4/16   5.6.7.8  x.myplace.org/24 # allowed addresses
