.knockcf(5)                    Doorman &amp; Knocker                   .knockcf(5)



<b>NAME</b>
       <b>.knockcf </b>- The <b>knock </b>configuration file

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  port-knocker  client  <b>knock </b> requires  a  configuration file named
       ".knockcf" to be in the user's home directory.  Any value in  the  file
       may be overridden by command-line parameters to <b>knock</b>

       The  file  consists  of  simple keyword-value pairs, one pair per line.
       The keyword and value must be separated by one or  more  space  or  tab
       characters.    Keywords are not case-sensitive, though most values are.
       Any part of a line following a '#' character is  ignored,  and  may  be
       used as a comment.  Blank lines are ignored.

       The file MUST be readable and writeable ONLY by the owner.


<b>RECORDS</b>
        <b>group </b> &lt;name&gt;
              This  specifies  the  group  name  (guest name) used to identify
              yourself.  Group names may be up to  32  characters  in  length.
              Both  group  names  and  secrets  may  contain  any alphanumeric
              character, as well as the characters:  !@$%^&amp;*()_-+=|{};:'"&lt;&gt;,?/

              Note  that  whitespace,  "#",  and the "." character (period, or
              decimal point) are not permitted.

        <b>secret </b> &lt;password&gt;
              This is the password used to authenticate you  to  the  doorman.
              Secrets   may be up to 64 characters in length, and use the same
              character set as group names.  The secret is catenated with  the
              IP  address  of the client machine and the seconds-of-epoch, and
              put through an MD5 hash before being sent to the doorman.

              This record may be omitted from .knockcf; if it is missing,  and
              the  secret  is  not  included  as an option on the command line
              (generally not a bright idea, anyway), 'knock' will  prompt  you
              for one.

        <b>port </b> &lt;integer, 1-65534&gt;
              Knock on the specified UDP port.  The default is port 1001.

        <b>run </b> "program  arg1 arg2 ... "
              Run  this  program  after  sending the knock packet, and after a
              1/10th second pause.  Note  that  the  entire  command  must  be
              enclosed  in  either  single  or  double  quotes.    Two special
              strings may be included to substitute for  command-line  parame-
              ters.   %H%  substitutes for the hostname or IP address, and %P%
              substitutes for the requested port number or service name.



 <b>AN </b><b>EXAMPLE</b>
       #
       #  If any of these records is missing, its value may be
       #  specified with a command-line option.
       #  (You may omit the secret from both, and wait to be prompted;
       #   this is perhaps the safest [or most paranoid] way on a unix host)
       #
       group       marketeers           # "Who you are" to the doorman
       secret      b1g%Hairy_[seCret}!  # &lt;- This is why no one else should
       #                                     be able to read this file...
       #                                     A PLAINTEXT PASSWORD!
       #
       port        1001                 # The UDP port the doorman is watching
       #
       run         "ssh -lmyname %H%"   # Run 'ssh' after knocking.
       #                                  The hostname used in the knock command
       #                                  will be subsituted in place of '%H%'.
