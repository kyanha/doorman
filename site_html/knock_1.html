knock(1)                       Doorman &amp; Knocker                      knock(1)



<b>NAME</b>
       <b>knock </b>- The port-knock client

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       knock [-h] [-v] [-f cfgpath] [-g groupid] [-p port] [-s secret] \
             [-r program arg1 arg2 ... ]   host  service


<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       "Knock  on  the  door"  of a host running the 'doorman' daemon.  If the
       conditions outlined below are met, a firewall rule will be created  for
       a  short  time  allowing  a TCP connection on the requested port.  If a
       connection is made within this time, the rule will  be  left  in  place
       until the connection is broken.
       No  reply is made to the knock; success is apparent only when a connec-
       tion to the requested server has been made.


<b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-h </b>     'help'; print a message explaining the options and quit.

       <b>-v </b>     'version'; print the version number and quit.

       <b>-p </b><b>port</b>
              Override the 'port' value in .knockcf.  Knock on  the  specified
              UDP port.

       <b>-f </b><b>cfgpath</b>
              Use  the  configuration  file specified by 'cfgpath' rather than
              ~/.knockcf

       <b>-g </b><b>groupid</b>
              Override the 'group' value in .knockcf

       <b>-r </b><b>"program </b><b>arg1 </b><b>arg2..."</b>
              Override the 'run' value in .knockcf.  Run  this  program  after
              sending  the  knock packet.  The argument list given to the pro-
              gram may include the special strings %H% and %P%.  '%H%' substi-
              tutes for the hostname to which the knock is sent; '%P%' substi-
              tutes for the portnumber or service name.

              Example:   knock -r"ssh -l myname %H%" abc.whatever.org ssh

              To avoid running the program specified by the 'run' record,  use
              any of:
              -r " " , -r ' ' , -r0 , -rX , or -rx

       <b>-s </b><b>secret</b>
              Override the 'secret' value in .knockcf

        <b>host </b> the IP address or DNS name of the host to which a TCP connection
              is desired.

        <b>service</b>
              the port number or service name (as defined in /etc/services) of
              the desired service.


<b>CONDITIONS</b>
       In order for a knock to succeed, the following conditions must be met:

       1. the groupid must be in the doorman's 'guestlist' file

       2. the secret must match that in the guestlist record for that group

       3.  the  IP address of the client machine's interface must match one of
       the addresses in the guestlist record.

       4. the service requested must be in the guestlist record

       5. A randomly-chosen number (called a  'tag')  is  sent  in  the  knock
       packet;  it  must  not occur in a list of old tags kept by the doorman.
       It may occasionally happen that a tag is found in  the  list,  and  the
       knock  will fail; there is no other remedy for this but to make another
       attempt.  However, since tags are 32 bits  in  magnitude,  such  occur-
       rences should be rare.


<b>FILES</b>
       <b>~/.knockcf:</b> the configuration file for 'knock'.
        '.knockcf' must be readable and writeable only by the owner.
